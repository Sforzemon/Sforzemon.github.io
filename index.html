        <p>See that guy to the left? He is one of the funniest people out there.  Now I don't want to say that I am obsessed with him, but he's pretty great, and I'm definitely not keeping constant tabs on his life or current whereabouts.  His musicianship, combined with his wit, makes him an ideal candidate for stalking... I mean... having fans.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Plus, did you even look at that picture? Have you ever seen hair like that?  It's like a mop affixed to the face of a Grecian God. Luxurious and curly brown locks of pure masculinity.</p>
        <br>
        <p>""... I'm literally drooling."  Is probably what you're thinking... perv.</p>

            <li>He is a smart and funny person who seems down to earth and this probably could have been split into multiple bullet points.</li>

        <h2>Some actual facts about "Weird Al".</h2>
