        <p>That guy up above, is one of the funniest people out there.  Now I don't want to say that I am obsessed with him, but he's pretty great, and I'm definitely not keeping constant tabs on his life or current whereabouts.  His musicianship, combined with his wit, makes him an ideal candidate for stalking... I mean... having fans.</p>

        <h2>So, why do I <s>dream about</s> like "Weird Al" anyway?</h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>He is fuzzy?</li>
            <li>He is cute?</li>
            <li>I feel like I am copying the Panda example a bit too closely.</li>
            <li>He is a smart and funny person who seems down to earth and this probably could have been split into multiple bullet points.</li>
            <li>Minimal home security system and a consistent schedule.</li>
